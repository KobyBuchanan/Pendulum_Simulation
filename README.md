# Pendulum_Simulation

A pendulum simulation made using the Pygame package. This is an intial project in a series of projects in which I will make physics based particle simulations.
The current physics engine assumes the small angle approximation for the pendulums, I will be making the physics engine more advanced in future builds.

# Planned changes
- Visual upgrade to the graphics and GUI elements
- User input controls 
- True pendulum behavior (string with mass, stiffness, etc.) and allowing damping and driving forces
- Double pendulum and coupled pendula
- possible addition of pendulumn in a fluid
